# Hunter-LC01-Textures
Files to use for textureing the Hunter LC01 Landing Craft.

This repository contains the UVs for the Hunter LC01. Saves me having top upload them all to SL then you to download them all etc.

The AOs for the Hunter LC01 are in the Texture box supplied with the boat.

There is a sample Photoshop PSD file here for the Hull 1 & Hull 2 texture. It is designed to be painted attached (2048 x 1024), then you split the file in two: 1024x x 1024 and save Hull_1.png and Hull_2.png
